title: D&D Purchase Options
---

# Explanation
I've done some light research and discovered that if we're willing to pay a little (naturally, the cost would be split among all of us)
there are some great options to make our games run a little easier. I.e. no one wants to look through the Player's Handbook for that *one* spell,
nor do they want to look through an online compendium only to discover the information they're looking for is locked or simply is unavailable.

Below I've outlined some basic information regarding 2 such options. If there are any questions or comments, make a post or private message on Discord.
I'd be delighted to know people's thoughts & opinions as soon as possible, but I intend to bring it up during next session regardless.
